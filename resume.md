## About

As a Unix Server Administrator at Murdoch University I accumulated two
decades of experience in supporting diverse technical teams in the Tertiary
Education Sector. More recently, I have experience in maintenance
of cloud infrastructure in AWS, within the resources sector.

Expertise includes performance testing, design and implementation of
integrations between services, and educating staff on the finer points of
regular expressions, SSL, and application configuration.

Conceptual, analytical skills and strong customer service skills combine to
create a supportive network environment where systems are maintained
effectively to deliver a secure, reliable operating environment.  My
objective is to continue to bring sensibly-implemented technical expertise
to the IT sector.

## Key skills

- linux server deployment and administration.
- server application configuration and administration, including database,
  backend and frontend services.
- experience with cloud tools and services, including Terraform, GitLab, and
  AWS.
- system monitoring and performance analysis.
- scripting, for automation, analysis, etc. Python, Perl, shell scripts.
- analysis and troubleshooting of complex systems.
- attentive to detail, security-minded, succinct.
- writing accessible and usable documentation and other communications.
- diligence and a desire to learn and improve.

## Experience

### Cloud Engineer - Modis
#### Nov 2021 - present

Modis is a business that provides IT and Engineering services to a range of
government and non-government organisations.

As a cloud engineer I worked with existing applications to improve their
reliability, security and performance. I also contributed to projects
that created new infrastructure.

### Unix Server Administrator - Murdoch University
#### May 2001 - July 2021

Murdoch University is a Perth-based university with 23,000 students and 1,700
staff, with campuses in Murdoch, Rockingham, Mandurah, Perth, Dubai, and
Singapore.

As a Unix Server Administrator I was responsible for building and
maintaining the OS on large portions of the university's Linux server fleet,
performance testing, design and implementation of integrations between
services, and problem troubleshooting.

- maintain server operating systems, including monitoring and patching.
- configure servers from raw metal (or blank VMware VM) all the way up to
  running services (usually apache).
- write and maintain integrations between applications.
- SSL certificate renewals.
- performance testing of systems involved in class signups (source of peak
  system load).
- assist other staff with their sysadmin tasks, problem diagnosis, etc.
- participate in the migration of systems from on-prem VMware to Azure cloud.

## Education

### Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) - Edith Cowan University
#### August 1994 - July 1996

Substantial progress (abandoned due to personal circumstances)

## Skills

### Cloud computing

- IaC: Terraform.
- source code management: GitLab, Bitbucket, CI/CD pipelines.
- AWS: good working knowledge of S3, SQS, SNS, IAM, Lambdas and step
  functions.
- azure: exposure to the azure portal and APIs, walinuxagent, application
  gateway.

### Unix systems administration

- primarily linux, but also exposure to Solaris and AIX. RHEL5 through
  RHEL9, Debian, RHEL/CentOS, Ubuntu.
- advanced Debian administration: dpkg, apt, package repositories.
- virtual servers: VMware, disk and volume management, LVM.
- networking: firewalls (iptables, iproute2), multi-interface routing.
- also: JVM monitoring, log collection and analysis.
- virtualisation: vmWare, libvirt.
- I know [regular expressions](https://xkcd.com/208/).

### Application administration and technologies

- web: apache (mod_rewrite, mod_proxy, mod_proxy_balancer, mod_macro, mod_fastcgi),
  nginx, reverse proxies, SSL certificates.
- mail: MTA configuration (sendmail, exim, postfix, saslauthd).
- system programming: perl, python, regular expressions, sqlite.
- network protocols: TCP/IP, SMTP, HTTP, SSL, SMTP, IMAP.
- integrations: Finance, Callista, HR.
- monitoring: nagios, mrtg, munin, smokeping.
- performance testing: creating better real-time monitoring capability,
  interpretation of testing results.

### Programming
- languages: Perl, shell script, Python. Exposure to PHP, Java, Javascript.
  Have also dabbled in Powershell and Javascript.
- data formats: CSV, JSON, YAML.
- workflow: subversion, git, Debian package development and repository
  maintenance. Regular user of Github/gitlab/GOGS.
- web: this resume is a Markdown [document](https://github.com/miiichael/cv)
  converted to HTML (though if you're reading this on Seek, then you're
  probably looking at a (probably out of date) PDF version that doesn't
  contain the benefits of my hand-written CSS...)

### Security
- keen interest in achieving best practices: correct use of firewalls,
  strong desire to keep software up to date, awareness of what techniques,
  strategies, protocols, etc to prefer and to avoid.

### Communication
- Precise and succinct communicator.
- Writer of accessible and usable documentation.

### Server room
- infrastructure: physical server installation and cabling, fault diagnosis, liasing with vendor engineers.
- tape library: backup tape handling, documentation.

### Favourite projects
- monitoring infrastructure. Filled a performance visibility gap by configuring munin and smokeping to monitor systems. This allowed creation of historical performance data across a large part of the server fleet.
- SSL certificate monitoring. Due to lack of SSL monitoring (for both expiry and misconfiguration), I wrote a tool that collected certificate information from web and other SSL-enabled services for reporting purposes. Was very useful when QuoVadis [unexpectedly revoked](https://www.auscert.org.au/blog/2021-01-15-quovadis-issue-impacting-multiple-customers) one of their intermediate certificates.

### Other attributes
- attention to detail.
- adherent of the KISS principle. Simplicity means reliability and
  maintainability.
- clean WA C class driver's license.
- former State Emergency Service volunteer, 2006-2012.

### Personal
Congratulations on reading this far!  I am grateful!  Assuming you didn't
cheat by just skipping straight to the end, that is...

Anyway, in my spare time I enjoy [photography](https://photos.deegan.id.au)
(taking photos, and, eventually, postprocessing them afterwards), Minecraft
(both as a player and server [admin](https://old.reddit.com/r/admincraft/)).

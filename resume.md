## Experience

### Unix Server Administrator - Murdoch University
#### May 2001 - July 2021

Programming and systems administration for Communications Services and
Computer Services within IT Services. Primarily known for maintaining
the OS on the Linux web server fleet, but also provided diverse skills
to ITS and its members.

## Education

### Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) - Edith Cowan University
#### August 1994 - July 1996

Substantial progress (abandoned due to personal circumstances)

## Skills and abilities

### Unix systems administration

- primarily linux, but also exposure to Solaris and AIX. Debian, RHEL/CentOS, Ubuntu.
- advanced Debian administration: dpkg, apt, package repositories.
- virtual servers: disk and volume management, LVM.
- networking: firewalls (iptables, iproute2), multi-interface routing.
- cloud: exposure to azure portal and APIs, walinuxagent, application
  gateway.
- also: JVM monitoring, log collection and analysis.
- virtualisation: vmWare, libvirt.
- I know [regular expressions](https://xkcd.com/208/).

### Application administration and technologies

- web: apache (mod_rewrite, mod_proxy, mod_proxy_balancer, mod_macro, mod_fastcgi),
  nginx, reverse proxies, SSL certificates.
- mail: MTA configuration (sendmail, exim, postfix, saslauthd).
- system programming: perl, python, regular expressions, sqlite.
- network protocols: TCP/IP, SMTP, HTTP, SSL, SMTP, IMAP.
- integrations: Finance, Callista, HR.
- monitoring: nagios, mrtg, munin, smokeping.
- performance testing: creating better real-time monitoring capability,
  interpretation of testing results.

### Programming
- languages: Perl, shell script, Python. Exposure to PHP, Java, Javascript.
- workflow: subversion, git, Debian package development and repository
  maintenance.
- web: this resume is a Markdown document converted to HTML.

### Security
- keen interest in achieving best practices: correct use of firewalls,
  strong desire to keep software up to date, awareness of what techniques,
  strategies, protocols, etc to prefer and to avoid.

### Communication
- Precise and succinct communicator.

### Server room
- infrastructure: physical server installation and cabling, fault diagnosis, liasing with vendor engineers.
- tape library: backup tape handling, documentation.

### Favourite projects
- monitoring infrastructure. Filled a performance visibility gap by configuring munin and smokeping to monitor systems. This allowed creation of historical performance data across a large part of the server fleet.
- SSL certificate monitoring. Due to lack of SSL monitoring (for both expiry and misconfiguration), I wrote a tool that collected certificate information from web and other SSL-enabled services for reporting purposes. Was very useful when QuoVadis [unexpectedly revoked](https://www.auscert.org.au/blog/2021-01-15-quovadis-issue-impacting-multiple-customers) one of their intermediate certificates.

### Other attributes
- attention to detail.
- adherent of the KISS principle.
